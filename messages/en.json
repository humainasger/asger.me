To work with companies that dare to take chances. Who want marketing that moves the needle. And who understand that B2B doesn't have to mean boring.\n\nAfter 10 years in the B2B SaaS trenches, I know what works. And more importantly - what doesn't.\n\nNow I help others break free from spreadsheet hell and actually have fun with marketing again. One focused initiative at a time.",
